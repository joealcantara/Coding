# Exercise 3.3
# Think of your favourite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores
# several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as 'I would like to own
# a Honda motorcycle'.

transport = ['Bus', 'Car', 'Motorcycle', 'Plane']
print(f"I don't take the {transport[0]} anymore.")
print(f"I prefer to take my {transport[1]}.")
print(f"In the Philippines, I once learned how to ride a {transport[2]}.")
print(f"When I take a {transport[3]}, I prefer to fly business class.")

print(f"{transport[1]} is better than {transport[0 ]}.")
