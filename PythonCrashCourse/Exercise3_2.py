# Exercise 3.2
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3.1, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them.
# The text of each message should be the same, but the message should be personalised with each person's name.

names = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']
message = f'Nice to meet you, {names[0]}!'
print(message)

message = f'Nice to meet you, {names[1]}!'
print(message)

message = f'Nice to meet you, {names[2]}!'
print(message)

message = f'Nice to meet you, {names[3]}!'
